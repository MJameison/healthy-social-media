Group repository for CS407
To use the requirements.txt file to set up your Venv for the project (as of writing just a flask API)

Use : \
pip install -r requirements.txt 

If theres like a Virtual environment that isn't there or anything make a Venv using
:\
python -m venv venv

Then for windows (This should work but I had to install a plugin for my IDE for bat files) :
venv\Scripts\activate

Or for Linux and Mac:
source myproject/bin/activate
